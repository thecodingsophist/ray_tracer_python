# ray_tracer_python
A ray-tracer built in Python following Peter Shirley's tutorials. 

To see what this project does, install ToyViewer from the app store and then open the .ppm files using ToyViewer. This shows the graphics that are being rendered in this project.

The color_bg.ppm file is still under construction. For further work, I need to write the python script such that the gradient of the blue background is vertical, not horizontal. I am having difficulty with finding this bug.
